/**
 * An in-batch precondition for D1. A batch runs as one transaction, so a statement that errors rolls back
 * every statement in it. `guard` is such a statement: it errors unless its condition holds, which lets a
 * batch check something (for example "no booking has appeared on a slot we are about to remove") at the
 * moment it runs, after earlier statements in the same batch and with no gap in which another request
 * could change the answer.
 *
 * The error is SQLite's "integer overflow", raised by `abs(-9223372036854775808)` (the one value whose
 * absolute value does not fit in 64 bits) in the ELSE branch of a CASE, so it is only evaluated when the
 * condition is false. Checked on local D1 (workerd's SQLite): the batch fails with
 * "D1_ERROR: integer overflow: SQLITE_ERROR" and nothing in it is written. The alternative,
 * `json(CASE WHEN ... THEN '1' ELSE 'x' END)` ("malformed JSON"), also works but could be mistaken for a
 * real JSON error from a json_each() parameter, whereas nothing else in these batches can overflow.
 * Production D1 is the same SQLite engine; this has not been run against remote D1.
 *
 * `conditionSql` is trusted SQL written by the caller, never user input; values go in `binds`. D1 allows
 * at most 100 bound parameters per statement, so pass a list as ONE JSON text and read it with json_each(?).

 * A guard that aborts the batch if the event's schedule definition is no longer what the handler read:
 * start, end, session length, gap or the set of breaks (name, price, break labels and the rest don't matter).
 * It closes the race where another admin edits the event between a handler's read and its batch, which could
 * otherwise put a booking on a slot the edit removed. The handler answers `event_changed` (or re-reads the
 * event) when the batch fails on it.
 *
 * The schedule depends only on the SET of (start, end) pairs: an identical duplicate break has the same effect
 * as one. So the breaks are compared as sets of `start|end` strings, in both directions, with no ordering or
 * aggregation (SQLite does not document the order of a subquery feeding `group_concat`). The handler's set goes
 * in as ONE JSON parameter, used twice.
