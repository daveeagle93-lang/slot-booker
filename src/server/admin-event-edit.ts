 * capacity increases event_layout.config_rev in the same batch, which is how a booking request that read the old layout fails
 * its own guard (db-guard.ts). The same holds for a draft that lists `fields` or `identityLimit`: written over the form it was made
 * from, and config_rev goes up when the identity limit, the number of fields, which of them identify a booking, a required flag or a
 * longest value changes (labels alone don't matter to a booking in flight). Once the event has bookings the number of fields and the
