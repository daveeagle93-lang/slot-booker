/**
 * Every route the Worker answers itself. Anything not listed is a 404 (under /api/) or a static file. The admin guard
 * is decided from the path alone, before this table is consulted (worker.ts), so an `access: "admin"` entry is
 * a statement of what the guard already enforces for /api/admin/*, and src/worker/routes.test.ts holds the two together.
 * Adding a route is a conscious edit here; adding a file under src/routes/ without it fails that test.
 *
 * `deps` are for tests (a fixed clock, a stubbed Access key fetch).
