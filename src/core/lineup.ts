/**
 * The running order as plain text for pasting into a chat. Pure: London wall-clock times from the UTC
 * instants (never the host's time zone), British English long date, 24-hour times.
 *
 * Nothing is escaped or marked up: names (the club's included) are printed exactly as stored, and the text adds no
 * formatting of its own. Names can't fake a new line (the server refuses control characters and U+2028/U+2029), but
 * WhatsApp's own markup characters (`*`, `_`, `~` and backticks) are allowed in names, so a name containing them
 * can still make part of the message bold, italic or struck through when pasted into the chat. That is not
 * coded around. Lane names are user text too and are printed the same way, as stored.
 *
 * One line per place: a booking shows the value of each of its fields, in the form's order, between " — " (`10:00 — Rex — Sam`).
 * An event with exactly one lane and that lane unnamed reads as in v1.0 (`10:00 — Rex — Sam`,
 * `10:00 — free`; with several places in the lane, the bookings in place order and then a `free` line for each free
 * place). Any other event names the lane in every line (`10:00 Ring 1 — Rex — Sam`, `10:00 Ring 1 — free`), by time,
 * then lane order, then place.
